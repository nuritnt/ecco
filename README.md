## How to use this project

### Q: How do I add an additional adapter to this repository?
Simply [fork](https://github.com/therod/ecco#fork-destination-box) this project, add the new adapter to your forked repository and send a new [pull-request](https://github.com/therod/ecco/compare).

## Todo

1. Script that gets the [lead article] with following [attributes] from these [7 newspapers].

## Newspapers (already implemented adapters are crossed out)
- ~~http://www.lemonde.fr~~
- ~~https://www.nzz.ch~~
- https://www.repubblica.it
- https://www.theguardian.com
- http://elpais.com
- https://www.nytimes.com
- http://www.dailymail.co.uk

2. Ability to write these attributes into a Database

3. Set up the system to run every [x] hours.

4. Avoid duplicates in the database.

5. Write a checker to see if our script works as intended.

6. Create a web interface

7. Extend the Database to include the translated articles.
